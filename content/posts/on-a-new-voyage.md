## It’s always about journey, on a new voyage now 

I’m writing this as I’ve just boarded Caltrain from San Francisco to Palo Alto. The Wi-Fi won’t connect, but the views are incredible. Emotions? All over the place. So, like always, I’m thinking about the road that got me here.

{{< figure src="/images/dump/2.jpg" alt="View from CalTrain Window" height="800">}}

### At Nine
Summer break at my mamu’s place. He had a Windows 95 PC, basically wonder to a kid who’d only seen computers in rich people’s houses. My cousin and I would sneak in to play games, and I’d ask anyone who’d listen: How does this box paint pictures? Why does a “mouse” move the arrow? Most answers were okayish, the rest were “shh.” People were irritated basically.

### The Long Beg
I begged my parents for a computer. But, understanding our financial condition, I stopped. But I was in lov with computers. I tried making friends who had a computer at home or a more advanced mobile phone, something that did more than just calling. Even in my dreams, I was in love with computers. I borrowed CS books from senior friends in my neighborhood. Most of the time, they thought I wouldn’t understand anything, but I just wanted to grasp everything written in those pages. I learned about hardware, how it works and which part does what. In 5th grade, I joined a local computer center that charged 250 rupees per month. I learned MS-DOS, spent a bunch of time playing with kernels & basically, by 11, I was assembling computers.

### Ghar ke Kalesh (Family squabbles) & some breakthroughs
My current school wasn’t competitive enough, hence I wanted another one. Had a huge Kalesh (family squabble) at home since the fee for the new school was a lot. But mom came to the rescue, sided with me.

But the new school’s computer lab was boring. Same HTML stuff being taught. There was no competition except for everyone fighting to get good marks. This was boring to me. I wasn’t allowed to do my own stuff on the school computer. So, now it was time to get my own computer. Time for another kalesh (family squabble) at home. There was no chance I was getting this. But my maternal uncle came to the rescue, arranged an old Lenovo All-in-One Desktop. This was my time. Hell yeah, after school I was glued to it. I had strict instructions that I would share it with my sister and wouldn’t perform any surgery on it.

Now, my time to shine. Grabbed my Pen Drive, installed bootable Kali Linux on it. And started the real cooking. I didn’t have Wi-Fi, so my world was limited and I couldn’t ask for Wi-Fi lol. So, let’s guess the neighbour’s Wi-Fi password. Lmao, I kept guessing for a week. But then, the ego in me wanted to get to the bottom of this. Read a few blogs on my phone. Wrote steps in my phone. And then,

- tested on surrounding Wi-Fi networks, back then there were a lot of ISPs whose routers had default common guessable passwords
- and Kali had built-in tools for pen-testing, airmon-ng did the best job for packet sniffing. Detected vulnerable Wi-Fis using airodump-ng and sent deauth packages. This would force clients to send some re-auth packages and we would sniff some of those packets
- this helped because we could then perform computation offline to regenerate something similar to auth packages, and this would almost give us what password or PSK would derive such a package

First few attempts failed, but yeah, with a new dictionary, I COULD FINALLY CRACK IT!!

### some early puns
In my 8th class, I learnt about Bitcoin and had a few satoshis in my wallet, but idk where that private key is now. I earned it by reading a few blogs and solving some quests. Back then, the only guy teaching about Bitcoin in Hindi was Sandeep Bahuguna.

Created a YouTube channel where I used to teach physics. Had 100K views on my YT channel back then. Lol. I deleted that channel btw, idk why, I just felt cringed. But I want it back now lol.

### Academics Cooked me
After 10th, academics took over JEE, NDA, and board prep all at once. Couldn’t afford coaching, but JIO Dhan Dana happened. Downloaded lectures from YouTube, which helped me clear boards and NDA (though I skipped SSB). JEE scores weren't good. Took a drop year,this year pattern changed lol, got two chances yayyy!! but still got cooked. Two subjects at 99.9 percentile, but one ruined the shot. Advanced didn’t go well either. IIT was out of hand now. Ended up in a nearby NIT (actually didn’t get top NITs).

College was in a different city. Moved to hostel. I could manage alone, but not without my PC which had to stay home, as my sister used it too. So now, in college with no PC, no books, just a Redmi Note 5 and zero motivation. Got wrecked in the first minor exams. Started studying on my phone, borrowed laptops when I could. But the spark was missing. I had dreamt of doing Iron Man level stuff in engineering. Reality was far off.

Started building on my phone. Used Replit, found apps to run C++ and Linux environments. Felt empty, had no friends, grades were slipping, doubts were creeping in. There was a hackathon by the DSC Club. I coded entirely on my phone, and won. Suddenly, I was alive again.
Here’s the LinkedIn post I made back then lol:
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhamkukreti_developerstudentclubs-code2success-webdevelopment-activity-6629801113094848512-FWum/

That’s when I felt alive again—building, breaking, figuring stuff out. Joined a few clubs. Contributed where it felt right.

### Covid & Lockdown
I came back home for the Holi holidays. Then COVID happened. Our minor exams got postponed, and soon after, the lockdown began. It was an unfortunate time, but it gave me a chance to reconnect with my computer. I also received a 2008 Lenovo laptop from my uncle. Now, I had my own machine and that changed everything.

With classes shifting online, all I had to do was open another tab. I started exploring GitHub, open source projects, and ended up winning bounties worth several thousand dollars. I joined a few online Discord communities. One of my pull requests to an open-source organization caught attention and led to a part-time opportunity, which eventually turned into a full-time role. That became a solid income stream.

I was able to help my family pay off their debts.

Participating in online hackathons and remote work brought in money I had never imagined earning before. I attended a hackathon hosted by Devfolio with Lightspeed as one leg of the flight was sponsored, which really helped:

Life finally felt on track. I bought myself a MacBook Air M1 (first machine with my own money). From there, I kept making steady progress, learning everything I could always with a deep sense of gratitude.

I consider myself LUCKY.

### Travels
Even before graduating, I worked full-time. I had built up a sufficient fund corpus, enough to keep me afloat and ensure I never had to struggle again for basic needs or go without proper computing power.

When my batch had its farewell, I went backpacking in Vietnam for 20 days. I covered everything from Phu Quoc Island to Hanoi and Halong Bay. To be honest, I was loving it and really wanted to do SAPA and the Ha Giang Loop, but I had to return for my exams. That trip was my first time visiting a foreign country.

Around the same time, I received a job offer that was 3x my current salary. I declined it. I genuinely liked where I was working, and there was no immediate need for more funds.

Since then, I’ve traveled to more countries for work and hackathons and I’ve loved every bit of it.

I met my co-founder in a Clubhouse in BLR. We exchanged ideas and started building a bunch of things together. It didn’t work out, but we shared a similar builder’s spirit.

### New Journey

While few days back, returning from Denver, I’ve just resigned from my current job to build something of my own. This is something I’ve always wanted to do. And I feel like now is my moment.

I’m not afraid of any situation. I’ve lived through what many would call the worst. There’s no backup plan. I’m back on the journey again. Let's see how it goes.

Caltrain’s slowing; Palo Alto’s next. Time to hop off and keep moving. Catch you on the other side. There’s a startup to build. 

Thanks for reading.
