just filed my big fat taxes after quitting my full-time job earlier this year. considered skipping and paying the fine later since most of this year was bootstrapping our startup, but went ahead anyway. I guess, my current arc is of being a good citizen.


anyway, now off for a walk on roads that barely qualify as walkable.
