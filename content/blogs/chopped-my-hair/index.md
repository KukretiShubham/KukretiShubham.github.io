If you know me, then you’ve definitely seen me with long hair. Like, *really* long. I’ve been growing it out for almost 1.5 years now.

And yep! I chopped it off this Sunday.

I know what you’re thinking: “WHY?!”

Okay, let’s rewind a bit.

So it all started during COVID. I was stuck at home like everyone else, and I didn’t get a haircut for six months. My hair had grown to a pretty decent length by then. When things started opening up again, I went to my regular barber or tried to.

He wasn’t there anymore. The place had been sold, and now there was some new guy. I saw that and ran the other way. LOL. I need my regular barber, okay? Am I a loyalist? TF, maybe.

Anyway, hair kept growing.

The next time I got a haircut was when I got back to college after backpacking in Vietnam. Finals were done. Before heading home, all the necessary stuff was wrapped up. That was the last chop before this Sunday.

After that, life was mostly remote, job, everything. So I was home a lot, and I just didn’t cut my hair again. 1.5 years passed. My mom was pushing all this time. She said she'd be the happiest person the day I get it cut. My grandmother? She was genuinely worried if I was going to be a hermit or turning into a hippie about to renounce the world. LOL.

But here’s why I kept growing it, I found out I could donate my hair.

There are people, especially those going through chemotherapy or dealing with other health issues, who lose their hair and can’t afford or access natural wigs. 

And I? I’ve got an unlimited growth source: my head 😂

So I kept going.

And finally, this Sunday, snip snip. It’s done. I’ll be mailing it to this amazing NGO run by cancer survivors who make and donate wigs either for free or at very minimal cost.

Then came Monday.

“OMG DUDE WTF. ARE YOU OKAYYY??!!”
The reactions were hilarious.

And honestly? It was fun.
