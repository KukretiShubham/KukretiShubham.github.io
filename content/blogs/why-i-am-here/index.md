## tl;dr - I don't know

I am an overthinker. I love to dive into more profound thoughts. Sometimes my thoughts are around real-world situations or experiences; sometimes, I develop different constructs and think from all different sides.


This over-thinking behaviour has led me to develop a habit of researching or going down the rabbit hole and not bringing conclusions from just a single side. And I love it.

Currently, I am learning about decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs, deep space and sometimes about ancient Hindu scriptures.

You may soon find me writing about these topics. 

The reason for not choosing a platform and hosting my blog site on my own is that I want to control my content. What if a platform were to delist my blog or remove all my writings?

Also, not so fancy reason. I love writing my blogs in a code editor.

Okay, I think it's enough for now. 

cya!
