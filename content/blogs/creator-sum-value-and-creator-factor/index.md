Readers might feel lost or not making sense of it. Totally alright. I am still working on it.

While using the word platform. I have two different context in mind. One is that shows a fixed metrics (UI) biased. Other is the protocol level or the underlying system.
## Creator Value (CV)
Creator Value is a mathematical fan-weighted value of a creator.
$$ CV = C_i \times F_i $$

## Creator Sum Value (CSV)

Creator Sum Value is the sum of all the Creator Values of a creator on all the platforms.
$$ CSV = \sum C_i \times F_i $$

_where,_
**$$ C_i = Creator Factor $$**
**$$ F_i = Fan Value $$**

Evaluating creators entirely based on platform metrics might not be a good idea. For example, a creator can have a huge fan base on a platform, but the fan base may need to be more active. Hence, the creator value is calculated by multiplying the creator factor with the fan value. Platforms can use this Creator Sum Value & Creator Value to calculate the real fan-weighted value of a creator. 


Its application lies in the following areas:
- A creator engagement platform wants to evaluate different creators and set their discovery
- Brand collaboration trust score
- Liveliness of a creator
- Evaluate the deviation from CSV to conversion value; a conversion value is a quantified output



## Creator Factor (CF)[To be revised]

The creator Factor lies in the range of 0 to 1. It is a measure of the creator’s engagement on a platform. Currently, there is no surety on how many variations it can take & still normalise between the range of 0 and 1.

For now, 

It is calculated by dividing the creator’s engagement on a platform by the total engagement volume.

$$ CF = \frac{E_i}{E_{total}} $$
_where,_
**$$ E_i = Engagement $$**
**$$ E_{total} = Total \ Engagement $$**

Further, this can be narrowed down to *true* engagement.

The engagement metric itself can be subjective and further questioned. Like "Like", "Share", "Comment", "View", "Watch Time", etc.
## Fan Value (FV)[To be revised]

For the scope of this article, Fan Value is the number of individuals driving the engagement on a platform for a particular creator.

Ideally, this should be easier to compute than the creator factor.
It becomes complex as the platforms have various ways of connecting the social graphs. It adds more to the problem when social-graphs are private by the big tech giants, even though connects via 'follow', 'connection', 'friend', 'subscriber' etc are public. 
So, you are forced to believe those ideal numbers as your Fan Value.

Decentralized social graphs give lesser pain, easier to generate dynamic value. And it is relatively easy to assign an individual respect score that further contributes to overall fan value.
