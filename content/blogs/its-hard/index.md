Being honest is difficult.

It's not easy to be neutral of the situation and take a decision. Demands a kind of courage that can feel almost punishing. Especially when you know you could loose it all and it would add more to the sufferings. but you anyways go and try. You might lose something precious, but you accept the cost.

Isn't it what exactly builds the character, adds more force and fierceness to your next action?

But, before you get here, you go through questions, Why me? Why am I always the one expected to show understanding? Why does the universe seem to demand maturity from me, while others get a pass? When will my time come? But after the storm passes and you’ve let go once more, there’s no one to blame, no one to vent to. You bow your head, swallow your pride, and return to your path.

The most humbling realisation arrives quietly when you remember they said "it’s not always about you". It stings, but you learn to accept it. Maybe, someday, things will shift in your favor. For now, you carry on. worth to remember is, if you tried with integrity and honesty.

This, I believe, is what transforms a boy into a man. You can employ a thousand tactics to manipulate outcomes and claim victory today, but in the long run, when you reflect on your journey, only integrity will spare you from disgust and regret. And regret is a burden I refuse to bear.
