Totally alright. I am still working on it.
While using the word platform. I have two different context in mind. One is that shows a fixed metrics (UI) biased. Other is the protocol level or the underlying system.
Creator Value (CV) Creator Value is a mathematical fan-weighted value of a creator. $$ CV = C_i \times F_i $$
Creator Sum Value (CSV) Creator Sum Value is the sum of all the Creator Values of a creator on all the platforms.</description></item><item><title>Why I am here</title><link>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/why-i-am-here/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 22:49:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/why-i-am-here/</guid><description>tl;dr - I don&amp;rsquo;t know I am an overthinker. I love to dive into more profound thoughts. Sometimes my thoughts are around real-world situations or experiences; sometimes, I develop different constructs and think from all different sides.
This over-thinking behaviour has led me to develop a habit of researching or going down the rabbit hole and not bringing conclusions from just a single side. And I love it.
Currently, I am learning about decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs, deep space and sometimes about ancient Hindu scriptures.</description></item></channel></rss>
