Or maybe I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like doing them. A few of the things were coming to me, I kept myself away, knowing I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to do justice to them. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the value of it, maybe. Or maybe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to take them on at that moment in my life. I knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to handle them well, since I was so busy in my life, focusing on what I love, what I wanted to achieve. So, I always denied it or resisted- said &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; in the rudest manner, so the &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; would make them realise how much of a douchebag I am, and feel better about not being in my company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, oh boy. When I felt I was ready, and felt the strongest pull this time, I thought, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all going fine,&amp;rdquo; and breaking all my prejudices. Not only did it all reverse this time, but the things that were cringe in my books&amp;hellip; And guess what? In my first time, situation &amp;amp; time kicked me. But, it&amp;rsquo;s okay. I am humbled. I learned a lot, every part, every bit of it was a learning. It made me feel unlucky about how I followed the principles which people say they admire, and still destiny denied me when I thought the time was for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am glad, i could really well understand the other side. I know people hate denials but rather i became more empathetic and respected them even more now. Also, taught me some nice way to say NO.
I know i am learning this a bit late now. But, learning is learning. Learn always.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, I think it&amp;rsquo;s alright. The world hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone down. But, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I will do this again. But, it&amp;rsquo;s not the same water. I got better learnings. This phase taught me so much. Also, I am proud of myself, yet I feel unlucky, but I am glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose on my values and didn&amp;rsquo;t become selfish. so, it was one of the best times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, my horrible style of writing includes (they, things, them). can&amp;rsquo;t help. this is how i write. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Research on AI and Machine Learning</title><link>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/research/sample-research/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/research/sample-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>WIP&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chopped My Hair</title><link>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/chopped-my-hair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 13:26:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/chopped-my-hair/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you know me, then you’ve definitely seen me with long hair. Like, &lt;em>really&lt;/em> long. I’ve been growing it out for almost 1.5 years now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yep! I chopped it off this Sunday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know what you’re thinking: “WHY?!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, let’s rewind a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it all started during COVID. I was stuck at home like everyone else, and I didn’t get a haircut for six months. My hair had grown to a pretty decent length by then. When things started opening up again, I went to my regular barber or tried to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He wasn’t there anymore. The place had been sold, and now there was some new guy. I saw that and ran the other way. LOL. I need my regular barber, okay? Am I a loyalist? TF, maybe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, hair kept growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next time I got a haircut was when I got back to college after backpacking in Vietnam. Finals were done. Before heading home, all the necessary stuff was wrapped up. That was the last chop before this Sunday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, life was mostly remote, job, everything. So I was home a lot, and I just didn’t cut my hair again. 1.5 years passed. My mom was pushing all this time. She said she&amp;rsquo;d be the happiest person the day I get it cut. My grandmother? She was genuinely worried if I was going to be a hermit or turning into a hippie about to renounce the world. LOL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But here’s why I kept growing it, I found out I could donate my hair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are people, especially those going through chemotherapy or dealing with other health issues, who lose their hair and can’t afford or access natural wigs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I? I’ve got an unlimited growth source: my head 😂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I kept going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, this Sunday, snip snip. It’s done. I’ll be mailing it to this amazing NGO run by cancer survivors who make and donate wigs either for free or at very minimal cost.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Then came Monday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“OMG DUDE WTF. ARE YOU OKAYYY??!!”
The reactions were hilarious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And honestly? It was fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Then to Now</title><link>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/then-to-now/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 20:25:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/then-to-now/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="i-think-its-the-journey">I think it&amp;rsquo;s the Journey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’m writing this as I’ve just boarded Caltrain from San Francisco to Palo Alto. The Wi-Fi won’t connect, but the views are incredible. Emotions? All over the place. So, like always, I’m thinking about the road that got me here.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="at-nine">At Nine&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Summer break at my mamu’s place. He had a Windows 95 PC, basically wonder to a kid who’d only seen computers in rich people’s houses. My cousin and I would sneak in to play games, and I’d ask anyone who’d listen: How does this box paint pictures? Why does a “mouse” move the arrow? Most answers were okayish, the rest were “shh.” People were irritated basically.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-long-beg">The Long Beg&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I begged my parents for a computer. But, understanding our financial condition, I stopped. But I was in lov with computers. I tried making friends who had a computer at home or a more advanced mobile phone, something that did more than just calling. Even in my dreams, I was in love with computers. I borrowed CS books from senior friends in my neighborhood. Most of the time, they thought I wouldn’t understand anything, but I just wanted to grasp everything written in those pages. I learned about hardware, how it works and which part does what. In 5th grade, I joined a local computer center that charged 250 rupees per month. I learned MS-DOS, spent a bunch of time playing with kernels &amp;amp; basically, by 11, I was assembling computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ghar-ke-kalesh-family-squabbles--some-breakthroughs">Ghar ke Kalesh (Family squabbles) &amp;amp; some breakthroughs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My current school wasn’t competitive enough, hence I wanted another one. Had a huge Kalesh (family squabble) at home since the fee for the new school was a lot. But mom came to the rescue, sided with me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the new school’s computer lab was boring. Same HTML stuff being taught. There was no competition except for everyone fighting to get good marks. This was boring to me. I wasn’t allowed to do my own stuff on the school computer. So, now it was time to get my own computer. Time for another kalesh (family squabble) at home. There was no chance I was getting this. But my maternal uncle came to the rescue, arranged an old Lenovo All-in-One Desktop. This was my time. Hell yeah, after school I was glued to it. I had strict instructions that I would share it with my sister and wouldn’t perform any surgery on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, my time to shine. Grabbed my Pen Drive, installed bootable Kali Linux on it. And started the real cooking. I didn’t have Wi-Fi, so my world was limited and I couldn’t ask for Wi-Fi lol. So, let’s guess the neighbour’s Wi-Fi password. Lmao, I kept guessing for a week. But then, the ego in me wanted to get to the bottom of this. Read a few blogs on my phone. Wrote steps in my phone. And then,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>tested on surrounding Wi-Fi networks, back then there were a lot of ISPs whose routers had default common guessable passwords&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and Kali had built-in tools for pen-testing, airmon-ng did the best job for packet sniffing. Detected vulnerable Wi-Fis using airodump-ng and sent deauth packages. This would force clients to send some re-auth packages and we would sniff some of those packets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this helped because we could then perform computation offline to regenerate something similar to auth packages, and this would almost give us what password or PSK would derive such a package&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>First few attempts failed, but yeah, with a new dictionary, I COULD FINALLY CRACK IT!!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="some-early-puns">some early puns&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In my 8th class, I learnt about Bitcoin and had a few satoshis in my wallet, but idk where that private key is now. I earned it by reading a few blogs and solving some quests. Back then, the only guy teaching about Bitcoin in Hindi was Sandeep Bahuguna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Created a YouTube channel where I used to teach physics. Had 100K views on my YT channel back then. Lol. I deleted that channel btw, idk why, I just felt cringed. But I want it back now lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="academics-cooked-me">Academics Cooked me&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After 10th, academics took over me JEE, NDA, and board prep all at once. Couldn’t afford coaching, but JIO Dhan Dhana Dhan happened. I could download lectures from YouTube, which helped me clear boards. But, JEE scores weren’t good. Had to take a drop year, this year pattern changed lol, got two chances yayyy!! but still got cooked. Two subjects at 99.9 percentile, but one ruined the shot. Advanced didn’t go well either. Top IITs were out of hand now. I ended up in NITJ (actually didn’t get top NITs either).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So college was in a different city. Had to move to hostel. I could manage alone, but not without my PC which had to stay home, as my sister used it too. So now, in college with no PC. Got wrecked in the first minor exams. Started studying on my phone (redmi note 5), borrowed laptops when I could. But the spark was missing. I had dreamt of doing Iron Man level stuff in engineering. Reality was far off. TBH frustating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Started building on my phone. Used Replit, found apps to run C++ and Linux environments. Still felt empty, made no friends, grades were slipping &amp;amp; doubts were creeping in. Then there was a hackathon by the DSC Club, a very small one. I coded entirely on my phone, and won.
Here’s the LinkedIn post I made back then lol:
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhamkukreti_developerstudentclubs-code2success-webdevelopment-activity-6629801113094848512-FWum/">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhamkukreti_developerstudentclubs-code2success-webdevelopment-activity-6629801113094848512-FWum/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s when I felt alive again. Building, breaking, figuring stuff out. Then I Joined a few clubs. Contributed where it felt right.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="covid--lockdown">Covid &amp;amp; Lockdown&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was back home for the Holi holidays. Then COVID happened. Our second sem minor exams got postponed, and soon after, the lockdown began. It was an unfortunate time, but it gave me a chance to reconnect with my computer. I also received a 2008 Lenovo laptop from my uncle. Now, I had my own machine (suddenly now two) and that changed everything. Fist thing i did first, was installed manjaro &amp;amp; custom shell. Now, i could build anything on this machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With classes shifting online, all I had to do was open another tab. Gave time to explore things like open source, communities, hackathons. I ended up winning bounties worth several thousand dollars. I created a small community with few online friends with a charter that after winning hackathon we would take up 80% &amp;amp; rest 20% we would give away to budding devs in the community. I remember giving away $5000 in total. During that time one of my pull requests to an open-source organization caught attention and led to a part-time opportunity, which eventually turned into a full-time role. That became a solid income stream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to help my family pay off their debts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Participating in online hackathons and remote work brought in money I had never imagined earning before. I attended a hackathon hosted by Devfolio with Lightspeed as one leg of the flight was sponsored, which really helped:

&lt;p>Life finally felt on track. I bought myself a MacBook Air M1 (first machine with my own money). From there, I kept making steady progress, learning everything I could with a deep sense of gratitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I consider myself LUCKY.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="travels">Travels&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now, even before graduating, I had full-time work exp. I had built up a sufficient fund corpus, enough to keep me afloat and ensure I never had to struggle again for basic needs or go without proper computing power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When my batch had its farewell, I went backpacking in Vietnam for 20 days. I covered everything from Phu Quoc Island to Hanoi and Halong Bay. To be honest, I was loving it and really wanted to do SAPA and the Ha Giang Loop, but I had to return for my exams. That trip was my first time visiting a foreign country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around the same time, I received a job offer that was 3x my current compensation. I declined it. I genuinely liked where I was working, and there was no immediate need for more funds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I’ve traveled to more countries for work and hackathons and I’ve loved every bit of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I met my co-founder in a Clubhouse in BLR. We exchanged ideas and started building a bunch of things together. It didn’t work out, but we shared a similar builder’s spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-journey">New Journey&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A few days back, just before heading back from Denver, I resigned from my job to start building something of my own. This is something I’ve always wanted to do, and it finally feels like the right time. I’m not scared of what’s ahead. I’ve already lived through what most would call the worst. There’s no safety net. I’m back on the road again. Let’s see where it takes me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’ve made it this far,
Thanks for sticking around and bearing with my blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Caltrain’s slowing; Palo Alto’s next. Time to hop off and keep moving. Catch you on the other side. There’s a startup to build.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creator Sum Value &amp; Creator Factor</title><link>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/creator-sum-value-and-creator-factor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 19:59:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/creator-sum-value-and-creator-factor/</guid><description>&lt;p>Readers might feel lost or not making sense of it. Totally alright. I am still working on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While using the word platform. I have two different context in mind. One is that shows a fixed metrics (UI) biased. Other is the protocol level or the underlying system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creator-value-cv">Creator Value (CV)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Creator Value is a mathematical fan-weighted value of a creator.
$$ CV = C_i \times F_i $$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creator-sum-value-csv">Creator Sum Value (CSV)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Creator Sum Value is the sum of all the Creator Values of a creator on all the platforms.
$$ CSV = \sum C_i \times F_i $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>where,&lt;/em>
&lt;strong>$$ C_i = Creator Factor $$&lt;/strong>
&lt;strong>$$ F_i = Fan Value $$&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evaluating creators entirely based on platform metrics might not be a good idea. For example, a creator can have a huge fan base on a platform, but the fan base may need to be more active. Hence, the creator value is calculated by multiplying the creator factor with the fan value. Platforms can use this Creator Sum Value &amp;amp; Creator Value to calculate the real fan-weighted value of a creator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its application lies in the following areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A creator engagement platform wants to evaluate different creators and set their discovery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brand collaboration trust score&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Liveliness of a creator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluate the deviation from CSV to conversion value; a conversion value is a quantified output&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="creator-factor-cfto-be-revised">Creator Factor (CF)[To be revised]&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The creator Factor lies in the range of 0 to 1. It is a measure of the creator’s engagement on a platform. Currently, there is no surety on how many variations it can take &amp;amp; still normalise between the range of 0 and 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is calculated by dividing the creator’s engagement on a platform by the total engagement volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ CF = \frac{E_i}{E_{total}} $$
&lt;em>where,&lt;/em>
&lt;strong>$$ E_i = Engagement $$&lt;/strong>
&lt;strong>$$ E_{total} = Total \ Engagement $$&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further, this can be narrowed down to &lt;em>true&lt;/em> engagement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The engagement metric itself can be subjective and further questioned. Like &amp;ldquo;Like&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Comment&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;View&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Watch Time&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fan-value-fvto-be-revised">Fan Value (FV)[To be revised]&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the scope of this article, Fan Value is the number of individuals driving the engagement on a platform for a particular creator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally, this should be easier to compute than the creator factor.
It becomes complex as the platforms have various ways of connecting the social graphs. It adds more to the problem when social-graphs are private by the big tech giants, even though connects via &amp;lsquo;follow&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;connection&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;subscriber&amp;rsquo; etc are public.
So, you are forced to believe those ideal numbers as your Fan Value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decentralized social graphs give lesser pain, easier to generate dynamic value. And it is relatively easy to assign an individual respect score that further contributes to overall fan value.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I am here</title><link>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/why-i-am-here/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 22:49:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/blogs/why-i-am-here/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://www.shubhamkukreti.com/images/myself/1.jpg"

&lt;h2 id="tldr---i-dont-know">tl;dr - I don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am an overthinker. I love to dive into more profound thoughts. Sometimes my thoughts are around real-world situations or experiences; sometimes, I develop different constructs and think from all different sides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This over-thinking behaviour has led me to develop a habit of researching or going down the rabbit hole and not bringing conclusions from just a single side. And I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, I am learning about decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs, deep space and sometimes about ancient Hindu scriptures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may soon find me writing about these topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason for not choosing a platform and hosting my blog site on my own is that I want to control my content. What if a platform were to delist my blog or remove all my writings?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, not so fancy reason. I love writing my blogs in a code editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, I think it&amp;rsquo;s enough for now.&lt;/p>
